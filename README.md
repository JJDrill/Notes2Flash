# Notes2Flash

## Overview
There are many applications that allow you to take notes and organize them online. There are also many applications that allow you to create your own flash cards. I wanted to create an application that will automatically generate flash cards from the notes you take, so I came up with Notes2Flash.

Notes2Flash parses the notes you already have into question and answer flash cards. An edit mode allows you to review the flash cards generated and modify them as necessary.
